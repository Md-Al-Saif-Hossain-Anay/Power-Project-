These calculations ensured the rewound motor maintained electromagnetic characteristics close to the original.

Winding Diagram

A complete three-phase winding diagram was developed, identifying:

Phase-A, Phase-B, and Phase-C coil placements

Slot positions of coil sides

Coil pitch and phase sequence

Grouping of coils for each pole

This served as the reference for rewinding and phasing during assembly.

Disassembly Procedure

The disassembly process included:

Removing outer housing and covers

Cutting and extracting old coils from the stator

Removing all old insulation papers

Cleaning the stator slots thoroughly

Measuring coil dimensions and old turn counts for verification

The stator was fully prepared for new insulation and rewinding.

Rewinding and Assembly
Slot Preparation and Insulation

Slot widths were measured and new insulating papers were cut accordingly

Slot liners were inserted individually to ensure electrical isolation

Coil Fabrication

New coils were formed using the calculated wire gauge

Coil shape and length were matched to the stator slot geometry

Coils were grouped and labeled for their respective phases

Coil Insertion and Final Assembly

Coils were inserted into designated slots following the winding diagram

Interlayer and interphase insulation were added

Coil terminals were trimmed, separated, and soldered properly

Varnish coating was applied to improve insulation and mechanical rigidity

End plates were reattached and secured

The completed stator assembly reflected correct phasing, coil pitch, and insulation integrity.

Testing and Evaluation

After rewinding, the motor underwent standard machine tests.

No-Load Test

Rated voltage applied at rated frequency

Input current and power measured using a wattmeter

Core losses, magnetizing current, and mechanical losses evaluated

DC Test

Stator resistance measured directly using a multimeter

Provided accurate input for equivalent circuit resistance calculations

Blocked-Rotor Test

Rotor mechanically locked and supplied with low voltage

Input voltage, current, and power recorded

Leakage reactances and short-circuit parameters derived

Equivalent Circuit

Using all test data, the per-phase equivalent circuit was constructed, yielding updated electrical parameters for the rewound motor.

Outcome of the Project

Successfully rewound and reassembled a three-phase induction motor

Verified correct performance through no-load, blocked-rotor, and DC tests

Extracted full equivalent circuit parameters

Demonstrated proper operation after rewinding

Gained hands-on understanding of coil fabrication, insulation techniques, motor assembly, and machine testing
