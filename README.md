Rewinding a 3-Phase 4-Pole Squirrel Cage Induction Motor
This repository documents the complete rewinding and testing of a three-phase, four-pole squirrel-cage induction motor as part of the Energy Conversion Laboratory (EEE 206). The project covers theoretical winding design, disassembly of the original motor, fabrication of new coils, preparation of slot insulation, reassembly of the stator, and verification through standard machine tests. Using the motor’s nameplate data, the required turns, coil pitch, and winding distribution were calculated, followed by the construction of a three-phase winding diagram. New coils were formed and inserted according to this layout, insulated, soldered, varnished, and mechanically secured. Performance was evaluated through no-load, DC resistance, and blocked-rotor tests, from which equivalent circuit parameters were derived. The results confirmed correct rewinding and stable operation of the machine. Supporting materials include calculations, diagrams, images, the project presentation, and the final report.
